    <p>Savitribai Phule, the first female teacher of the first women’s school in India is a pioneer figure. She
      relentlessly fought against the dominant caste system and worked towards the upliftment of the marginalized.

      She demanded dignity for all women, for which she, along with her husband Jyotirao Phule worked their entire
      lives. The principles of humanity, equality, liberty and justice were of utmost importance to her. During a time
      when women were mere objects, she ignited a spark that led to equality in education – something which was
